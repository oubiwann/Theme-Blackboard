## About

VimBlackboard is a simple theme based on Blackboard (as one might imagine).
Blackboard, in turn, is mostly derived from
[Flatland](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/flatland), the right place to start
for any custom theme development for Sublime. Thanks Flatland!


## Installation
Blackboard is a Sublime package. To install it:

1. [Download theme
   files](https://github.com/oubiwann/Theme-VimBlackboard/archive/master.zip)
2. Unzip the files and copy the folder called "Theme - VimBlackboard" into your
   Sublime Text 2 Packages directory. You can find that directory by selecting
   "Preferences > Browse Packages ...".
3. Activate the theme by modifying your user preferences to include the
   following:

```javascript
{
  "theme": "VimBlackboard.sublime-theme",
  "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme-VimBlackboard/Theme - VimBlackboard/VimBlackboard.tmtheme"
}
```

If you need help locating your user preferences file, you can find it selecting
"Preferences > Settings - User".
